<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

2048 is a strategic puzzle game created by Gabriele Cirulli in March 2014.
The goal is to combine numbered tiles to reach the number 2048.
Players move tiles on a 4x4 grid, merging them to create higher numbers.
Each move requires careful planning and strategy. The game is open-source and was first released on GitHub.

The project was divided in 3 parts for lunching the game: 

1/ In the terminal
2/ With SDL2 librairy
3/ With SFML librairy
